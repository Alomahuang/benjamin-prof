This project is using Angular, which is currently hosted with Firebase due to Angular routing issue with GitHub Pages.

The idea of this project is to build a minimalism website with a good resolution to read.

Another thing noted to bring up is, I combine markdown files with Angualr, which gives this project a potential to be a blog, and we plan to make it a blog too!
